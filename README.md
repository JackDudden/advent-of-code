# Advent of Code Solutions

My solutions to advent of code in Python. Each year can be found in
a separate folder, with the solution for each day in a folder
underneath.

A `main.py` function can be used to run the solution code against
my personal inputs, with any required input being stored as a
file alongside.

The main code for the solution can be found within the adjacent files,
with tests available that are based on any examples provided by
advent of code.
